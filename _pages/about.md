Hey, I am Vedaant, Math&CS major at UIUC. As an undergrad, I have worked on various machine learning problems.

Intially, I designed rigorous **evaluations**, [HumorDB](/VedaantJain/humordb), to benchmark complex scene reasoning in vision and multimodal models. Then I helped develop the first certification framework for LLM's reading comprehension, [LLMCert-C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15929), to move beyond static test sets and formalize desired properties. Nowadays, I focus on explainable adversarial scene generation for multimodal models and ML for biology.

Additionally, on the systems side, I have written custom CUDA and AWS Trainium kernels, and implemented a unified paging system for KV cache and multi-rank LoRA adapters, similar to S-LoRA.

I also interned at Kumo.AI in summer of 2025 and Metaphor Data in summer of 2024.

Some of my fun class projects have included: [Interpretability for priming/prefilling attacks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1quz4Ubq23HJ_2HjBWLa9_UV7RKuiHIF4/view?usp=sharing), [mimicking reddit users with LLMs](https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1YwwlxxUZqJPKe-9yeYiuzK_q5-hp8-Q0/view?usp=sharing), [curriculum learning/RL for embodied agents](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MHmBkW5XuC6Rg9wT6vZrFTwWN7G9Ru7a/view), [parkinson's disease progression](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/13MvQHiNv7XWAz2NiIbmRUeUTVYVADV_r?usp=sharing).
